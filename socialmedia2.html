        The arrival of COVID has led to a dependence on checking social media
        every waking moment to distract the brain from the impending doom of the
        world ending.<br /><br />

        However, the Internet is far different than it was in 2005. Silly games
        have turned into data tracking, racist cyberbullies, and
        doomscrolling.<br /><br />

        Despite wanting to get off the trail most days, the only thing we can do
        is trek on and see where it goes.<br /><br />
