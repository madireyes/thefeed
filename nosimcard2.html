        This phone lacks a phone number! Messaging can only be done through
        email, apps have parental restrictions, and you need permission to
        download anything and everything!<br /><br />

        Entertainment is provided with the preset Apple apps and emoji art in
        the Notes app. But do you expect anything more from an 8-year old with
        strict Asian parents?<br /><br />
